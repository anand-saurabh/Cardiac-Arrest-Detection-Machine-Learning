# Cardiac Arrest Detection using Machine Learning

In this project, I have implemented various machine learning classification algorithm to predict whether a person suffers from a sudden Cardiac Arrest. I have comapared the 
efficiencies of various algorithms by tuning the parameters of each algorithm. The algorithms implemented in this project are Support Vector Machine,
Naiye Bayes Classifer, Decision tree and Random Forest.
